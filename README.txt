The two scripts available in this folder, submit.pl and submitter.pl,
were written to make it easier to submit data to the European Nucleotide
Archive (ENA) at the EMBL-EBI outside of Cambridge, UK.


submit.pl
========================================================================
This script both uploads data files and submits various XML files to the
ENA.


submitter.pl
========================================================================
This script uses submit.pl to upload a data file provided by the user
and the associated XML files, also provided by the user.  It then
creates a template analysis XML file that may be filled in and submitted
separately using the submit.pl script.
